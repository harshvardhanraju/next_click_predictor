# Next Click Prediction System: Technical Summary

## Executive Overview

I've developed an end-to-end machine learning system that predicts where users will click next on web interfaces using a novel combination of computer vision, Bayesian probabilistic modeling, and explainable AI techniques. The system addresses a critical challenge in UX optimization and user behavior prediction by providing both accurate predictions and interpretable explanations.

## Core Technical Architecture

The system implements a modular pipeline architecture with five specialized components working in sequence. At its heart is a **dynamic Bayesian network** that models click probability as a function of user characteristics, task context, and UI element properties. Unlike static recommendation systems, this approach constructs the probabilistic model on-the-fly based on the detected interface elements, making it adaptable to any web page or application.

The **computer vision pipeline** leverages OpenCV for edge detection and contour analysis to identify UI elements like buttons and forms, while EasyOCR handles text extraction and recognition. This dual approach ensures comprehensive element detection across different interface designs. Each detected element gets enriched with spatial, visual, and semantic features including position weights, color contrast ratios, and content relevance scores.

## Probabilistic Modeling Innovation

The Bayesian network design represents the core innovation. Rather than using black-box deep learning, I chose an interpretable probabilistic approach that encodes domain knowledge through conditional probability distributions. The network models relationships between user demographics (age, experience level), task characteristics (urgency, complexity), and UI properties (prominence, content relevance) to compute click probabilities.

This approach offers several advantages: it handles uncertainty naturally, provides confidence estimates, and enables human-interpretable explanations. When pgmpy isn't available, the system gracefully falls back to heuristic-based scoring using visual prominence and content matching.

## Feature Engineering and Integration

A significant engineering challenge was combining heterogeneous data sources - user profiles, natural language task descriptions, and visual interface analysis - into a unified feature representation. I implemented a feature integration engine that performs semantic analysis on task descriptions, encodes categorical user attributes, and computes multi-dimensional compatibility scores between users, tasks, and UI elements.

The system dynamically adjusts feature weights based on context. For instance, during high-urgency tasks, it amplifies the importance of familiar UI patterns, while for novice users, it prioritizes visual prominence cues. This adaptive weighting makes the predictions more contextually appropriate.

## Explainable AI Implementation

Beyond prediction accuracy, the system generates detailed explanations using factor analysis and reasoning chain construction. It identifies the most influential factors contributing to each prediction and creates human-readable explanations like "This button scored highest due to strong visual prominence (35% weight) and direct task relevance (28% weight)." This explainability is crucial for user trust and system debugging.



## Impact and Applications

This system bridges the gap between academic ML research and practical UX optimization tools. It can enhance A/B testing platforms, improve accessibility tools, and power intelligent UI assistance systems. The interpretable approach makes it suitable for domains requiring explainable decisions, unlike typical black-box recommendation systems.

The combination of computer vision, probabilistic reasoning, and explainable AI demonstrates how classical ML techniques can be effectively combined to solve complex real-world problems while maintaining interpretability and reliability.
